API-Quandl

Data


Qaundl is currently the most widely used aggregator of financial market data. In this project, data is pulled from the Quandl API.

At first, I need to register a free account on the http://www.quandl.com website.
After I registered, I was provided with a unique API key, that I should store: Store the API key as a string - according to PEP8, constants are always named in all upper case API_KEY = ''




Focus


For this mini project, I focused on equities data from the Frankfurt Stock Exhange (FSE), which is available for free. I analyzed the stock prices of a company called Carl Zeiss Meditec, which manufactures tools for eye examinations, as well as medical lasers for laser eye surgery: https://www.zeiss.com/meditec/int/home.html. The company is listed under the stock ticker AFX_X.
